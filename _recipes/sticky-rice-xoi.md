## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage
-|-:
Glutinous Rice | 100%
Coconut Milk | 50%
Water | 25%
Shredded Coconut | 15%
Salt | 1.5%

For the topping, it's a 50/50 mix of sugar and nuts or sesame seeds.
Add a heavy pinch of salt, to give it a sweet-savoury profile.

## Technique

1. Soak the rice overnight.
    This step is not required if pressure cooking.
1. Combine ingredients.
1. Cook using steamer, rice cooker, or pressure cooker.
    This will take longer than jasmine rice, probably 2-3 times the cook time.

Using the Instant Pot, this is 15 minutes on high pressure, with natural release.
