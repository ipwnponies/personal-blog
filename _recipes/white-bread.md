## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage | Weight for 1 lb loaf pan (g)
-|-:|-:
Flour | 100% | 360
Water or Milk | 65% | 235
Butter (melted) | 6% | 20
Honey or Sugar | 6% | 20
Yeast | 1.5% | 5
Salt | 2% | 7

## Note

Yeast is 7 g == 2.25 tsp.

The yeast was very vigorous in my warm kitchen (25 C). Consider using less yeast and allowing a longer rise (maybe 70%).

## Technique

1. Mix everything in a stand mixer.
    The dough should be smooth (not sticky) and very soft when done, >10 minutes.
    Alternatively, knead by hand.
    This will require slap and fold technique.
1. Rise dough for 60-90 minutes.
1. Punch down dough and pat out into a rectangle.
    Envelop fold and roll into a tight log.
    Be sure to tighten and seal the seam.
1. Put dough into a greased and floured pan.
    Allow to rise for 45 minutes.
1. Preheat oven to 350F (175C).
1. Bake for 40 minutes.
    When crust starts getting brown, cover with tin foil.
    Bread is done when at 195-200F.
1. Remove from rack after 5 minutes.
    Cool on rack completely before bagging away.
